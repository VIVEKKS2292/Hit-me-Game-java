#Hit-me

This repository consists of the source code for the simple GUI-based game "Hit-me."

The game has 3 levels: beginner, intermediate, and expert, each consisting of 2 tasks. In all these levels, as the user clicks (hits) the demon, he gains points. Intermediate level adds a diversion with a moving fire, clicking on which the user loses a point. The expert level adds a moving bomb; a click on it ends the game. Different hit targets, miss targets, and time constraints add to the increasing complexity as the user floats across levels. The user can change the background color and switch on or off music as per his licking.

The game is built using Java's GUI kit, i.e., Swings and Awt.

The game may further add a scoreboard and login feature in its future development.
